<p>Introduction</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>Moreland Road is a street in the city of Bath, England.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>One Friday evening in March, at six o'clock, people were coming home
from work as usual. The schoolchildren were already at home.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>A woman's voice was coming from number 12. 'Jason, are you doing your
homework? You've got to do it before you go out to see Maria tonight.'
But there was no answer. Jason was listening to music and couldn't hear
his mum.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>At number 48 David Sen wasn't home yet, but his wife was.
Thirty-two-year-old Nina Sen was tired after a long week of work at the
bank. She had some news for her husband, but she wasn't sure how to tell
him.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>Across the street was number 75. Maggie was in the living room,
sitting on the sofa. She was thinking about something. It was a nice
something, because she had a smile on her face.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>And then there was Sam Davies, from number 56. He was walking slowly
home, looking a bit worried. Actually, he always looked worried. Money
was his problem. He never had enough for everything. How was he going to
tell his wife that they couldn't have a holiday this year?</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>So, just another ordinary Friday...</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p> </p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p> </p>
</div>
<div class="s2">
<p>CHAPTER ONE</p>
</div>
<div class="s">
<p>Jason's future</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Jason! Did you hear me? Are you working?' Jason's mum heard nothing
from his room. She decided to go and see what was happening.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>She stood outside the door of his bedroom for a minute and then she
walked in. Jason was sitting on the floor and looking at some
photos.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'What are you doing, Jason?' she asked.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>Jason turned off his music and looked up.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Do you remember this?' He gave her a photo. 'It's me when I was
five, and Maria. She was really pretty - well, she still is. It was my
birthday party, wasn't it?'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Yes, I think so,' his mum said.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'It was the last birthday before Dad left,' Jason said. 'I remember
it very well.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'The party, or the day Dad left?' asked his mum.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Both,' said Jason. 'In my mind, they both happened on the same
day.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'They didn't, but it all happened a long time ago,' his mum replied.
She walked to the window so Jason couldn't see her face.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>Simon, her husband, left their house in Moreland Road early one
morning twelve years ago. He wrote her a letter and put it on the
kitchen table. And then he left. For twelve years she didn't hear from
him. No letters, no birthday cards for Jason. Then, last week, there was
a phone call. 'Why did you go?' she asked Simon again and again. He
wanted to meet her. 'No,' she said, but she wanted to say yes.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>Jason's mum turned away from the window. 'Jason, what about your
homework?' she said. 'Why are you looking at old photos?'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'I want to find all the ones I've got of Maria. I want to take them
with me to London, you know, when I go to art school.' He smiled at a
funny photo of Maria, aged eleven.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'It's a bit early to think about all that, Jason,' his mum said.
'You're not going until the autumn. And you don't know if you're going
to get a place at the art school.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'I will, I'm sure I will. When I went to visit them two weeks ago
they said, "We think your work's very good. We really like your
ideas."'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'I know, but... anyway, where are you going with Maria tonight?'
asked his mum.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Broad Street Bar. There's a great reggae band on,' said Jason.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Have you told her about going away to art school in September?'
asked his mum.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Yeah. She's fine about it, I think,' he replied. 'I can come home at
the weekends.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'You won't...' his mother began and then stopped.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'I know what you're thinking,' said Jason. 'But we're different.
We'll always be together.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>His mother left the room and went downstairs. 'Maybe Jason and Maria
are different,' she thought. 'They've known each other since they
started primary school. But I thought Simon and I were different, and
look what happened.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Mum.' Jason came into the kitchen. 'I'm going round to Maria's now.
I'll have something to eat at her house. OK?'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Have you finished your work?' asked his mum.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Yes. Stop asking me. See you later - about twelve. OK?' And Jason
left the house before his mum had time to say anything else. Five
minutes later the phone rang. Jason's mum jumped out of her chair,
looked at the phone and thought 'Simon.' She answered it. 'Hello,' she
said in a very quiet voice.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Oh, hi, Mrs Campbell. Is Jason there?'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Maria!' Jason's mum almost shouted her name. 'No, sorry, he's left.
He's on his way to your house.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Oh no!' said Maria.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Is there a problem?' Jason's mum asked.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'No... Yes, I can't go out with him tonight. But it's OK, I'll tell
him when he arrives here,' answered Maria. 'Bye.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>Jason's mum sat down. She drank a little red wine. She thought about
the phone call from Maria. She thought that Maria's voice was a bit
strange. She hoped nothing was wrong.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p> </p>
</div>
<div class="s2">
<p>CHAPTER TWO</p>
</div>
<div class="s">
<p>Nina's new job</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>Nina Sen's work at the bank was over for the week. She was at home at
48, Moreland Road with her six-year-old son, Max. He was eating sausages
and chips.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'I got 100 percent in maths today,' he said.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Did you? That's great!' Nina answered. 'You're good with numbers -
just like me.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Is Dad at work?' asked Max.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Yes, but he'll be home soon. He's got the evening off,' Nina
replied. David Sen worked as the top cook at Julie's, an expensive
French restaurant. He worked long hours and very often he didn't get
home until late.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Oh good! Mum, can my friend Adam come to football with us tomorrow?'
asked Max.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Of course he can. Do you want to watch a bit of TV after dinner?'
Nina wanted some time to think before David came home.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>But she didn't get much time, because ten minutes later she heard
David come in.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Hi, Nina.' David kissed her. 'Where's Max?'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Watching TV,' said Nina. 'How was the restaurant today?'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Good. You know Dan?' asked David. 'The new assistant in the kitchen?
Well, one of my cooks was ill today so Dan did some cooking. And he was
great. He has a French grandmother and he can remember some of the food
she made. So he's got lots of ideas for the new menu.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Daddy, Daddy!' Max shouted, running into the room.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Hello, tiger,' said David. 'Let's go and read a story, and then you
can tell me all about your day.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>Father and son left the kitchen. Nina could hear Max's excited voice.
He was really happy to see his father.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'I'm lucky,' thought Nina. 'Why do I want to change things?'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>She cooked dinner for herself and David.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Are you ready to eat?' asked Nina when David came back to the
kitchen. 'There's something I want to talk to you about.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Mmm. I'm not sure I like the sound of that. Is it something
important?' he asked.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'The director from head office came to the bank today. He told me I
was the manager of the month,' Nina said.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Well done! Does that mean you'll get more money?' David laughed.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'In a way, yes. He asked me to be the manager in Newcastle. That's a
really big bank, about five times the size of the one here.' Nina
stopped and looked at David's face. 'So yes, more money.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Ah,' was David's only answer. Then a few seconds later, 'And what
did you say?'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'I said I was interested,' Nina answered. 'I also said I wanted to
talk to you. What do you think?'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'First thought,' said David, who stood up to get a glass of water,
'well done you. You work hard and I'm pleased for you. Second thought -
what about my job? Third thought - Newcastle is so far away from
here.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'I thought all that too,' said Nina. She went across the kitchen and
stood with her arms around David.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'And what about Max? He loves his school and his friends. And there's
my mum and dad to think about,' continued David. 'I know they live in
Exeter, but it's only a hundred kilometres from Bath and we see them
quite often.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'They could come with us. I'm sure they'll be happy in Newcastle.
Your mum was born near there, wasn't she?' Nina was trying to think of
some more good reasons. She really wanted this new job.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Yes, but they have all their friends around them now, and they love
living in Exeter,' David answered. 'It's a big thing to move at their
age.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Forget them for a minute. What about you?' asked Nina.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Well, you know I love working at Julie's,' David replied. 'We've got
a good name since that newspaper wrote about us. It's an exciting time,
and I don't really want to leave. Of course, I'm sorry the restaurant
isn't mine, but we haven't got the money to buy it, so...'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'I really want to say yes, David,' Nina said. 'I think this is just
the beginning. Maybe I could become manager for a big area in a few
years and after that. Well, who knows? Then we could buy two restaurants
and...'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Slow down,' said David with a smile. 'We haven't decided yet. When
does the job start?'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'In three months,' replied Nina. 'David, we're still young. It could
be exciting to start again in a new city.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'True,' replied David slowly. 'When do you have to give the bank an
answer?'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Well, they want me to decide by the beginning of next week,' Nina
said.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Say yes, then,' said David quickly.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'What?' Nina looked at David. She couldn't believe it.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Well, we can't buy Julie's - that's what I'd really like,' David
answered. 'But I can get another job in a good restaurant in Newcastle.
And your work is important. I know you love it.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Oh, David, you're wonderful. I'm so pleased I married you!' Nina
laughed. 'I'm going to write to head office and tell them before you
change your mind.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>David pulled Nina close and kissed her. 'I hope we've done the right
thing,' he said. 'Anyway, now I'm going to have a long hot bath and
think about it. And then I must phone Mum and Dad - I haven't spoken to
them all week.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Don't tell them yet about Newcastle,' said Nina. 'Let's keep it to
ourselves for the weekend.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>Nina sat at the table and wrote. Then she walked down Moreland Road
with her letter and put it in the post box on the corner. She heard a
soft 'plop' sound as it fell onto the other letters in the box. 'We've
decided what to do and nothing can change that now,' she thought.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p> </p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p> </p>
</div>
<div class="s2">
<p>CHAPTER THREE</p>
</div>
<div class="s">
<p>Dinner at Maggie's</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>Maggie was sitting on the sofa. She had a photo in her hand. She was
thinking about her holiday in Chile last month. She and her friend Belen
went to Chile for three weeks, walking in the Andes mountains. It was a
wonderful time. 'Well, actually, I don't think the holiday was as
wonderful for Belen as it was for me,' Maggie thought. She looked at the
photo and saw a happy group of young people.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>They looked happy because the day's walking was finished. They were
also happy because that was the day they saw the beautiful bird. A
condor, the famous bird of the Andes, flew high above them in the sky
that day and stayed with them for hours. Maggie was sad to see it fly
away at the end of the day.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'It was a very important bird for the Inca people, you know,' said
Xavier, their group leader. 'On lots of old Inca buildings you can see
an unusual cross. It's unusual because it has three levels. Like this.'
And Xavier drew the cross on the ground.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>He continued, 'For the Incas, each level was a different world - the
lower world, this world and the higher world. And there was an animal
for each world. The higher world had the condor. So you see, these birds
were very special, very important for the Inca people.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>The group were interested in Xavier's stories. Belen was more
interested in Xavier. From day one Maggie knew that Belen liked Xavier.
Well, he was great-looking and friendly with everyone. Belen talked to
Maggie a lot about Xavier. What he said to her, how she felt. 'This is
exactly what she was like when we were at school together,' thought
Maggie. 'I hope I don't have to listen to this all holiday.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>At the end of the first week, Maggie went for a walk after dinner
without the others. She didn't go far. She just wanted to be quiet and
on her own with the stars in the dark sky. She stood looking up and then
she knew that someone was behind her. She turned round and saw
Xavier.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Are you OK, Maggie?' he asked.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Fine,' she replied. 'It's beautiful here, isn't it? I love the
mountains. It's so different from where I come from.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'I was born near here, so I love it too,' Xavier said.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>They sat and talked for a long time. She learnt about his life and
about the life of ordinary people in Chile.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>From that day, she and Xavier had a special friendship. They often
talked together after dinner, and something more than a friendship
began. And of course Belen saw it.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'It's OK, Maggie, really,' said Belen. 'I don't mind.' But Maggie
felt she did mind, and sometimes she saw Belen looking at her rather
coldly.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>But at the end of the holiday things were OK between the two friends.
And Belen actually said she wanted to go on holiday with Maggie
again.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>Maggie got up slowly from the sofa. She enjoyed dreaming about her
time in Chile, but she had to make dinner. Belen was coming tonight. She
walked into the kitchen and started cooking the meat for the
lasagne.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Oh, I forgot to buy the tomatoes,' she thought. She took her money
and left the house. She walked quickly to the shop at the end of her
street.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>In her house the phone rang and, of course, nobody answered it. Then
the answerphone started: 'Hi, this is Maggie. Sorry, I'm not here to
take your call but please leave your name and number, and I'll call you
back later. Thanks.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>There was a small noise at the other end of the phone - someone was
getting ready to speak. But the person didn't leave a message or their
name and number.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>Maggie came back with the tomatoes. She saw the message light on the
phone. 'Probably Belen,' she thought. 'Maybe she's going to be
late.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>Maggie played the message, but there was nothing to listen to.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Strange,' she thought.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>She went into the kitchen and finished the lasagne. Then she took a
glass of red wine into the living room. She picked up the phone.
'Telephone number 07788536782 called today at 19:00 hours,' she
heard.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>Maggie wrote the number down and thought, 'I don't know anyone with
that mobile number. '</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>But then she heard someone at the front door. It was Belen.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Hi, Maggie,' said Belen and gave her a kiss. 'Mmm, something smells
good.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>They walked into the living room and Maggie gave Belen a glass of
wine.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'It's good to see you,' said Maggie. 'You look great. I love your
hair.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Thanks. And how's the lovely Xavier?' asked Belen. 'Have you heard
from him?'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Yeah, I have,' said Maggie. 'I got an email last week. He was in an
Internet cafe in Santiago.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Great! I thought it was just a holiday romance. But I'm really
pleased for you... No, really I am,' said Belen quickly when she saw
Maggie looking carefully at her.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'He says he's coming to England very soon - maybe next week,' said
Maggie.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Really! So soon? It must be love!' said Belen with a smile.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Well, I don't know about that.' Maggie laughed. 'He doesn't say
anything about love. Just that he's coming and that he's written me a
letter to tell me everything.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Everything about what?' Belen asked.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'I don't know. It's a bit of a strange email. Look, you can read it.'
Maggie gave the email to Belen. She read:</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>Hi condor-girl</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>I'm coming to England very soon. I need to get away from Chile for a
bit. Have written to tell you everything. Can't say much now. Looking
forward to seeing you a lot.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>Much love</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">

<p>CHAPTER FOUR</p>
</div>
<div class="s">
<p>Sam has money problems</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>Sam arrived at his house, number 56. The lights were on in every
room, and he could see his sixteen-year-old daughter, Emma, sitting at
her computer in her bedroom.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>Sam went inside the house and put his bag down. 'Wonderful,' he
thought. 'No more work until Monday.' Sam worked for the town's
newspaper - the Bath Chronicle. He was a reporter, but not a very
important one. He quite liked his job, but he didn't get a lot of money
for it. When he started work at the newspaper twenty years ago, he had
big ideas. He wanted to work there for a few years, and then move to
London to work for one of the big newspapers. But time moved on and he
didn't.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>Sam still wrote about the ordinary lives of people in Bath and
sometimes... sometimes a big story. Then all the people on the paper had
to work together and it felt good again - for a short time.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Hannah, where are you?' called Sam.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Upstairs with Alicia,' a voice replied.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>Sam went upstairs and found his wife, Hannah, in the bathroom.
Two-year-old Alicia was playing in the bath with about ten yellow
plastic ducks.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Hello, my favourite two girls,' said Sam and kissed them both.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'I heard that, Dad,' called Emma from her bedroom. 'What about me? I
thought I was your favourite.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'That was yesterday - when you made me a cup of tea,' said Sam and
walked into his older daughter's room. Emma was looking at something on
the Internet.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'I'm trying to find something about Chile for my geography teacher,'
said Emma and turned to give her father a kiss.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Go and ask Maggie. She's just come back from Chile,' replied her
father.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'No, it's OK. I'll find it on the Internet. It's quicker. Anyway, she
probably doesn't know much about the Mapuche Indians. Dad, you know I
really like geography, don't you?' asked Emma.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Yes,' replied her father.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Well, our teacher wants to take us to Norway after school finishes
in the summer. She told us about it today. It sounds wonderful. Can I
go?' Emma looked at her father. He could see how excited she was.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'It'll be expensive, won't it?' asked Sam.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'I'm not sure,' replied Emma, but she knew it wasn't cheap. 'There's
the money I got for my birthday. We can use that.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Yes, but that's not enough for a holiday to Norway. I'll talk to
your mum about it,' said Sam, and he left the room - again thinking
about money.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>Sam went into his other daughter's bedroom. Hannah was sitting on the
bed. Alicia was nearly asleep so Sam kissed her goodnight.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'How much does Emma need for Norway?' he asked Hannah as they walked
downstairs.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'A lot - about 700 pounds, I think. And she has to tell her teacher
on Monday if she's going,' replied Hannah. 'She really wants to,
Sam.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'I know. I'll try to find the money from somewhere.' Sam walked into
the back garden for a cigarette. Hannah sat down at the kitchen table to
read the newspaper.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>Hannah looked up when Sam came back in and said, 'I could get a job,
Sam. But I really want to stay at home with Alicia for a bit
longer.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'I know, and that's fine,' said Sam. 'I'll ask Jeremy to lend us some
money. I don't like doing it, but I've done it before.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>His older brother, Jeremy, had a good job. He worked in the world of
computers where nobody thought about not having enough money. Jeremy was
strong - some people thought he was hard, not strong. Every job he got
was better than the last one. He wasn't happy if life was too quiet and
easy. He was a doer, not a thinker. His wife was the same. They both
worked and played really hard. 'It's good that they don't have any
children because there isn't enough time for them in their lives,'
thought Sam. Jeremy didn't understand how expensive children were. And
Sam hated asking his brother for money. He could tell that Jeremy felt
sorry for his younger brother.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Why don't you get a better job, Sam?' Jeremy always asked. 'You're
intelligent, you could do anything.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'I like my job,' replied Sam. 'I don't want to work anywhere else.'
That wasn't really true, but he could never let Jeremy know that.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>And this was the same conversation Sam and Jeremy had on the phone
that Friday evening. But then it changed...</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'I'm sorry, Sam, but I'm not going to lend you the money,' said
Jeremy.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Pardon?' said Sam.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'No, no money this time. You need to think about your job. Get a job
with more money. You've got to change, Sam. Every time you need money,
you come to me. Well, I think it's too easy.' Jeremy stopped.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>Sam put the phone down. His head was hurting. He couldn't believe it.
His own brother didn't want to help him. His own brother talked to him
like that, and made him feel small and dirty.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>Sam went back into the kitchen.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'What did he say?' asked Hannah.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Fine,' said Sam. 'He'll lend us the money, so Emma can go to
Norway.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'I know it's difficult for you to ask, so thank you, my love,' said
Hannah and kissed him. Sam didn't look at Hannah and went to find
Emma.</p>

<p>CHAPTER FIVE</p>
</div>
<div class="s">
<p>Jason and Maria</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>Maria opened the front door of her house and let Jason in.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Hi,' said Jason and kissed Maria. She took his head in her hands and
looked at him for a few seconds.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'What are you looking at? Have I got something on my face?' asked
Jason, and he kissed her again.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'No, I just wanted to look at you - you've got a lovely face,'
replied Maria and walked into the living room.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Are you OK?' asked Jason, following her. 'I haven't seen much of you
this week.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'I'm fine,' replied Maria. Then she turned and looked at Jason. She
saw someone who was her best friend. She saw a person she loved, but she
knew that she was going to change everything.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Jason, sit down. I need to talk to you,' said Maria. She took his
hand. 'There isn't an easy way to say this, but I've met someone
else.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'What do you mean - met someone else?' For a moment Jason didn't
understand. Then his face went white.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'When I was on holiday with my family in France at New Year I met a
man and...' (this was the difficult bit to say) 'and I think I love
him.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'You said you love me,' said Jason in a loud voice.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'I did. I do. I do love you, but maybe like a brother. I feel a
different love for Francois.' Maria looked at Jason. 'Oh Jason, I'm
sorry. I didn't want this to happen.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'You don't love him,' said Jason. 'It was just a holiday romance. How
can you fall in love with someone else? Have you heard from him since
the holiday? Have you seen him? Does he say that he loves you?'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Yes, he loves me too,' Maria answered. 'We've emailed each other
every day, and he came to London last week for a few days. I saw him
then when I stayed at my sister's.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'You told me your sister wanted to spend some time with you,' said
Jason. 'So that wasn't true, was it?'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>Jason looked at Maria. He couldn't believe what was happening.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'When we finish school in the summer, I'm going to Paris to study.
Francois is studying there at the moment,' Maria said, not looking at
Jason.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'You've thought of everything, haven't you? When did you decide all
this?' Jason asked.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>Maria didn't reply.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>Jason got up, put on his coat and said, 'I'm going. I can't stay
here. It hurts just to look at you.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Will you be all right?' asked Maria.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'I don't know. And anyway it's not your problem now, is it?' replied
Jason angrily.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Jason, please don't,' said Maria. 'Don't go. We need to talk some
more.' But Jason was already running out of the front door.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>He ran and ran until he couldn't run any more. He wasn't angry any
more, but just so sad. He started to walk slowly home. He hoped his
mother was out - he didn't want to talk to anyone.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>When he got to his house, he saw the lights were on. He tried to open
the door quietly, but he couldn't.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Is that you, Jason?' called his mother from the living room.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Yes,' he replied.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>She came to the door of the living room. 'Why are you back so
early?'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'I'll tell you tomorrow,' replied Jason. 'I'm going to my room
now.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Please can you come into the living room for a moment,' his mother
said.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Do I have to?' asked Jason.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Yes,' his mother replied.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>Jason followed his mother into the living room and saw a man sitting
on the sofa.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Jason,' said his mother. 'This is your father, Simon.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>Jason looked at the man and said nothing. Simon said nothing, but
couldn't look at Jason. After a minute or two Jason said coldly, 'So
where have you been for the last twelve years?'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>His father replied, 'It's difficult, but let me try and tell you what
happened.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>But Jason didn't want to hear any more things that evening. For the
second time that day he ran out of a house. He went to the river and sat
looking at the water. He felt lost. Everything was different. Maria
loved someone else. A strange man - someone he called 'Dad' twelve years
ago - was sitting in his house. Jason felt he was going mad.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>The weather was cold and it was raining, but he just sat looking at
the river. For a moment he thought about jumping into the water and
letting it take him away. 'Who will be sorry? Nobody,' he thought. But,
deep inside, he didn't really believe that.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>He put his hand into his pocket and found some cigarettes. He lit
one, stood up and turned away from the river. For hours he walked the
streets of Bath. The rain was still falling and he was wet through. At
about three o'clock in the morning he was outside the city's mail depot.
There was a lot happening. Big vans were arriving with bags of letters.
Jason was happy to stand outside the gate and watch the bags going into
the building. He stopped thinking about his problems for a bit and time
passed. One of the men shouted to him, 'Hey mate, you all right? Want a
job or something?' Jason didn't answer.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>A voice called out from inside the building, 'Harry, tea's ready.
Leave those bags and come and get it.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>The big gate opened to let the next van in. And Jason just followed.
The man at the gate didn't see him behind the van - he was too busy
reading his newspaper. The driver got out of the van and went inside.
Then there was nobody but Jason. He wanted to get out of the rain, so he
got into the van and sat down between the bags of letters. It was dry
and comfortable. He smoked his last cigarette and then closed his
eyes.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>He woke up a short time later when he heard the sound of people
laughing in the building. For a moment he didn't know where he was. Then
he remembered. He knew he must go home and talk to his mother. Then
there was his father. Jason was angry with him, but he did want to know
why he was back. 'And I don't want anyone to find me in this van,' he
thought. He jumped out and waited in the dark for the gate to open
again. When it did, he ran out.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>A voice called out behind him, 'Hey, you! Stop!' But he didn't. He
ran on. His head was hurting and his clothes felt wet and
uncomfortable.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>There was only one thing in his life that made him feel good - going
away to art school in the autumn. It was really important that he heard
from the London art school soon.</p>

<div class="s2">
<p>CHAPTER SIX</p>
</div>
<div class="s">
<p>Nina and David talk</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>David lay in the bath. He thought about Nina's new job, and about all
of them moving to Newcastle. He loved working at Julie's and he was
sorry to leave it. And Max liked his school. But Nina was important too.
David knew she was wonderful at her job.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>He got out of the bath and put on his jeans and a blue sweater. He
went into Max's bedroom. His son was asleep. David sat on his bed for a
few minutes. Then he gave him a kiss, turned off the light and left the
room.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Just going to phone Mum and Dad,' David called to Nina.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'OK. Remember, don't tell them about my new job,' said Nina.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'No, I won't,' replied David.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>David phoned his father.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Hi, Dad. Are you OK?'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Fine,' replied his father. 'Your mother and I had a lovely walk by
the sea this afternoon. Anyway, it's good you phoned. We wanted to tell
you there's something in the post for you. For your birthday on Tuesday.
It'll be a surprise, I know, but I hope it's a good surprise.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'That sounds interesting,' said David. 'Are you going to tell me
anything more about it?'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'No, you'll have to wait. Let me just get your mother. I know she
wants to speak to you,' his father said.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Joan!' his father shouted to his mother. 'It's David on the
phone.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Coming.' David heard his mother's voice. And then he heard her say
in a quiet voice to his father, 'Have you told him?' and the answer,
'No.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Hello, David,' said his mother. 'Are we going to see you soon? Can
you come down next weekend?'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Yes, on Sunday,' said David. 'We can't on Saturday because I'm
working, but Sunday will be fine.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Oh good,' replied his mother happily. 'We want to see our lovely
grandson again. We're lucky that you live near so we can see him quite
often.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>David said something, but all the time he was thinking, 'How can we
tell them that we're taking him away to Newcastle?'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'I'll give the phone back to your father now. I know he wants to tell
you something about the garden,' his mother said. 'See you all next
Sunday.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Bye, Mum,' David said. He then listened to his father talking about
some ideas he had for his garden. David could hear how excited he was.
His father was only really happy when he was outside and doing
things.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>At the end of the conversation his father said again, 'I hope our
surprise for your birthday is what you want.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'I'll ring you as soon as I get it,' replied David. 'Bye for now,
Dad.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>David put the phone down and walked into the living room.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Everything OK?' asked Nina.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Yes, fine,' said David. 'I said we'll go down to see them next
Sunday for the day. That's OK, isn't it?'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Sure.' Nina saw the look on David's face.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Mum said how she loved having Max so near,' said David, 'and I felt
bad. They're getting older and they'll be so sad when we tell them about
Newcastle.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Oh, David, I know, but they'll want us to do the right thing for us
- as a family,' replied Nina.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'But now I really don't know if it is the right thing any more,' said
David quietly.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>They talked for hours and the questions were always the same: 'Is it
right for us to go to Newcastle?', 'Do we ask your parents to go with
us?', 'Do we forget about the new job and stay in Bath?'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>And then there was a new idea: maybe David and Max could stay in Bath
and Nina could go to Newcastle for the week and come home every weekend.
But how could David look after Max and work in the restaurant?</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>In the end they agreed. It was the same as their earlier decision.
Newcastle in June for all the family.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'It'll be OK, won't it?' asked Nina.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'I hope so, love,' replied David. 'I really hope so.'</p>

<p>CHAPTER SEVEN</p>
</div>
<div class="s">
<p>Maggie's visitor</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>Belen gave Xavier's email back to Maggie.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'That's very strange,' she said. 'Maybe he's done something wrong -
perhaps the police are after him or something.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'No, not Xavier,' said Maggie.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Why not, Maggie?' answered Belen. 'I mean, we were only in Chile for
three weeks. How well do we know him? Have you had any other emails or
letters from him?'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Yes, an earlier email, but it didn't say anything about coming to
England,' replied Maggie.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Oh well, there's nothing you can do - just wait for the letter and
hope it's nothing bad,' said Belen.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'I've just remembered something. Do you mind if I make a quick call?'
asked Maggie. 'Someone phoned me just before you arrived, but they
didn't leave a message.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Go ahead,' said Belen. 'I'll go into the kitchen.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'No, no problem,' answered Maggie. 'Stay. I won't be a minute. Then
we can eat.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>Maggie rang the mobile number.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Hello,' said a foreign voice. It was a man.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Oh hello,' said Maggie. 'You called this number earlier - Bath
726549. Who are you?'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'I'm sorry,' answered the man. 'It was a wrong number.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Oh, OK. Bye then,' said Maggie and put the phone down.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Wrong number.' Maggie turned to Belen. 'Someone with a
Spanish-sounding voice, I think.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'From Chile, perhaps?' asked Belen.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Maybe,' said Maggie. 'Anyway, it's not important. Let's go into the
kitchen and have dinner.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>Maggie and Belen ate the lasagne. They looked at photos from their
holiday and laughed at some of the things they remembered.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>There was a noise from the living room and they both jumped.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'It's OK.' Maggie laughed. 'It's only the window. When it's windy, it
always makes a noise.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>But then there was another, different noise. Someone was at the front
door.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'What a bad time to call,' said Maggie.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>She walked to the front door. When she opened it, she saw a man.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Yes?' she asked. 'Can I help you?'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Are you Maggie Cox?' asked the man.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Yes,' answered Maggie. 'And who...' But she didn't finish her
question.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>The man came into the house and closed the door behind him.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Excuse me!' said Maggie angrily. 'What are you doing? Who are
you?'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>Belen heard her shouting and came out of the kitchen.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Sit down, both of you,' said the man quietly. 'I don't want to hurt
you.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>Belen and Maggie sat together on the sofa.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'I'm looking for a friend of yours - Xavier Santos,' said the
man.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'He's not here,' said Maggie and Belen at the same time.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Who are you?' asked Maggie.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Let's just say I'm a friend of the Santos family,' answered the man.
'I know he's in England, and I want to talk to him.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'I haven't heard from him since we got back from Chile,' said Maggie
quickly.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Really?' said the man. He walked round the room and looked at
everything - postcards from friends on holiday, the phone bill that was
on top of the TV. Then Maggie remembered Xavier's email - it was on the
table next to her. It was too late to move it. The man saw it.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'So this is from another Xavier, is it? Where's the letter he talks
about in the email?' asked the man.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'I haven't had it yet,' said Maggie. She was afraid and she could
feel Belen was too. She didn't understand what the man was doing in her
house.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'How did you know where I live?' asked Maggie.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'I found your address in Xavier's home,' said the man. 'And your
photo. Did you have a good time in my country, Maggie?'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>Maggie didn't answer the question. She asked, but half of her didn't
want to know, 'Why are you looking for Xavier?'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'He's got something that I want,' said the man. 'But maybe he gave it
to you to bring back to England.' The man walked up to Maggie and stood
very close.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'He didn't give me anything,' said Maggie.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Maybe he didn't, but I know that Xavier will come here soon. And
when he does, I'll be ready for him.' The man looked hard at Maggie.
'You did a bad thing, Maggie, when you chose Xavier,' said the man.
'He's not right for a nice girl like you.' He moved away. 'Remember,
Maggie, I'll come back.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>Belen and Maggie jumped up when the man left. 'You must phone the
police, Maggie,' said Belen. 'This is terrible. You must come home with
me. You're not safe here.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>Maggie phoned and told the police everything. She told them, 'I'm not
going to stay here. I'm going to stay with a friend tonight. You can
call me on my mobile, 04776 567831.' The police asked her to go to the
police station the next day.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>Maggie put some things in a bag, ready to leave with Belen.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'I'm so stupid,' said Maggie. 'I thought Xavier was really nice. I
believed he loved me, but he was just playing.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>Maggie and Belen called a taxi and left Moreland Road half an hour
later.</p>

<p>CHAPTER EIGHT</p>
</div>
<div class="s">
<p>What Sam didn't know</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'How am I going to find 700 pounds?' thought Sam that Friday evening.
'And why didn't I tell Hannah about Jeremy?'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>But it was too late now. Emma was going to Norway. 'That's so great,
Dad! Thank you,' she said and kissed him. It made Sam happy to see her
so excited.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'I know what I'll do,' thought Sam sadly. 'On Monday morning I'll
take some of the jewellery my mother gave me before she died. There's a
jeweller's shop on the way to work. I'm sure they'll be interested in
buying diamond rings.' Sam didn't want to sell the jewellery. He knew
his mother wanted Emma to have it.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Maybe my brother is right,' he thought. 'I do need a job with better
money. I don't know how much longer we can go on like this.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s2">
<p>***</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>That Friday morning, six hundred kilometres away in the city of
Edinburgh, something important happened that could change Sam's life.
But Sam knew nothing about it.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>Two people, a man and a woman, arrived at the offices of lawyers
Barrett, Grabbe and Lennox.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>A man took the two visitors upstairs to the office of Frank Barrett.
It was a very old-fashioned place with big, dark wood furniture. There
were hundreds of law books all around the room.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Good morning,' said Mr Barrett to the visitors. 'It's Paul and Sonia
Cooper, isn't it? Please sit down.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Thank you,' said Sonia and sat down next to her brother, Paul.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'I'm sorry about your father,' said Mr Barrett. 'We looked after his
business for years here.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Thank you,' said Paul. 'He was ninety-one when he died. But now we
need to know what he decided to do with his money and things.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Paul!' said Sonia. 'That sounds terrible!'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'It's OK,' said Mr Barrett. 'Let me tell you what he wrote in his
will.' Mr Barrett didn't always enjoy reading a will to a family.
Sometimes there were surprises in it that they didn't like.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'I leave my house and all that is in the house to my two children,
Paul and Sonia. My money I give to my grandchildren, Robert, Amy and
Charlie.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>Paul and Sonia looked pleased. He continued, 'But not all of it.'
Their smiles became smaller.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'I want to leave some of my money to a special person who was a good
friend to me in my life - Samuel Davies.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'About thirty years ago, when my wife died, Sam lived next door to
me. He was a young man, but he spent many hours with me at that time. He
visited me most days and listened to me when I talked about my wife. He
was a true friend. I have never forgotten how kind he was. I want to say
thank you to him and to give him 50,000 pounds.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>A few minutes later, Mr Barrett finished reading and the office was
quiet. Then Paul Cooper said, 'Samuel Davies is a lucky man - 50,000
pounds is a lot of money, just for talking to Dad.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>And Sonia said, 'I don't remember him. Well, that's what Dad wanted
to do, and it's his money, so that's that. We can't change anything. But
how much will there be for the grandchildren - Paul's children?'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'I'm not sure yet. We'll have to wait and see,' said Mr Barrett. 'We
have to let Samuel Davies know. It could take quite a long time - you
know, the address your father gave us could be wrong now. But I'll write
to you as soon as I know.'</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'But if you don't find him, what happens to the money?' asked
Sonia.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>'Oh, I'm sure we'll find him. It could take months, but we usually
find people in the end,' replied Mr Barrett.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>Paul and Sonia left the lawyer's office quietly. Mr Barrett gave some
papers to his secretary and she wrote a letter to Samuel Davies. At
lunchtime she took the letter to the post office. As she put it in the
post box, she thought, 'Lucky Samuel Davies. What's he going to do with
50,000 pounds?'</p>
</div>
<div class="s2">

<div class="s1">
<p>Back in Bath that Friday evening, of course Sam had no idea about Mr
Cooper and his money. He went to bed unhappy. Was it right to sell his
mother's jewellery? And what job could a man his age get that paid more
money?</p>

<p>Fire!</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>At three-thirty on the morning of Saturday 15th March, a small fire
started in a van at the back of the mail depot in Bath. Nobody saw it at
first because everyone was inside the building.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>Then someone smelled something and shouted, 'Fire!' Another person
ran outside and saw what was happening. Someone else phoned the fire
service. They tried to put out the fire, but they couldn't.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>The fire service arrived very quickly and put out the fire. But two
big bags of letters were lost. In those bags were four very important
letters for some people in Moreland Road.</p>

<p>First of all, Happy Birthday! We hope you have a really lovely
day.</p>

<p>We've been thinking about our future and we want to do something with
our money. We have enough for ourselves, so we've decided to spend some.
We know how hard you work at Julie's and we know that you've always
wanted it to be yours. So we've bought it for you. We met Jean-Pierre
last month and agreed a price. Yesterday we heard that it's now ours -
well, yours actually.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>We both know that you're going to make the restaurant better than
ever. Can we come to dinner on your first big night?</p>

<p>I'm coming to England because I must leave Chile. I haven't done
anything wrong, but my brother has. He's in with some bad people. My
brother has disappeared - nobody knows where he is. His 'friends' think
I've got some of his papers, but I haven't. So I want to come to England
and get away from all these problems. Maybe I can get a job and stay
there for a bit.</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>Also I want to see you. I think we're at the beginning of an exciting
time together.</p>

DONE NOTHING WRONG. Please email me and tell me I can come.</p>

<p>Conclusion</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>And what happened to Jason, David and Nina, Maggie and the Davies
family?</p>
</div>
<div class="s2">
<p>***</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>Jason went away for two weeks to stay with his grandmother. She
looked after him and he began to feel better about himself. When he got
back to Bath he was sad that there was still no letter from the art
school in London. He phoned the school, but it was too late. The school
said he could have a place the next year. For a year, Jason stayed in
Bath and did lots of different jobs. Simon, his father, came to the
house sometimes and Jason began, slowly and carefully, to get to know
him.</p>
</div>
<div class="s2">
<p>***</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>Nina's letter to the head office of the bank arrived safely. David
never got the letter from his parents, but his mum and dad phoned him on
his birthday and he learnt about the restaurant. It was the best
birthday present in the world. Nina decided to work in Newcastle and
come home at the weekends. They were lucky because David's niece came to
study at Bath University. She stayed with them and looked after Max. But
it wasn't easy for the family. David wanted Nina to come home and work
with him in the restaurant, but she stayed at the bank in Newcastle for
eighteen months. Then she took the job of area manager in Bristol - a
city twenty-five kilometres from Bath.</p>
</div>
<div class="s2">
<p>***</p>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<p>Maggie never heard from the Chilean visitor again. She never heard
from Xavier again either, and he never arrived in England. Maggie was
very sad. She really thought that she and Xavier were great together. It
was hard for her. She wanted to believe that he was a good person, but
all her friends told her to forget him. Sometimes she thought about
going back to Chile to find him. But in the end, she didn't. She decided
that probably it was just a holiday romance for him after all.</p>

<p>Sam sold his mother's jewellery and gave Emma the money. After a few
days, he had another conversation with his brother. Then he decided to
leave his job at the newspaper and write a book. He worked at home so he
could look after Alicia too. At first, it was strange for him, but
slowly he began to enjoy his new life. It was exciting to write and
Alicia was an easy child. Hannah got a good job in a shop, which she
enjoyed. They were still short of money, but one day about three months
later he got a letter from Barrett, Grabbe and Lennox. Life began to
look a lot better for Sam and his family.</p>
